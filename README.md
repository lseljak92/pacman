# Term Project - Pac-Man
This project consists on practicing good OOP in Java by implementing a game that reuses the abstract classes and methods from the Tank Wars Game into a new and different game. This game is a version of the arcade game Pac-Man. It was made using IntelliJ IDE using Java version 8 update 221. The game fullfils the following requirements:
1. Pac-Man character must move left and right, up and down through the maze.
2. Pac-Man character must "rotate" based on the direction.
3. Pac-Man game must contain power ups for extra points.
4. Pac-Man character must avoid enemies (ghosts).
5. Pac-Man must have life count.
6. Pac-Man must show player's score.
7. In the Pac-Man game enemies must move randomly.
8. There has to be a connector path between the left and the right of the screen. If Pac-Man takes path towards left, he will then be displayed on the right.
9. Pac-Man game must have yellow circles that must be collected by the player.
10. All circles need to be eaten for the player to win the game. 
11. Pac-Man game needs to have at least four ghosts/enemies.

Some extra functionalities of the original arcade game were also applied. For example, one of the power ups allows Pac-Man to be "stronger" than the enemies. Its health is not affected when he collects larger Pac-Dots.
